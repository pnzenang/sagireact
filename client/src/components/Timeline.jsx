              Before 2009
            </h4>
            <p className=' text-lg leading-8 px-6 sm:px-14 text-base-content'>
              Up until 2009, when an African family in general and Cameroonian
              in particular was struck by the death of a member, most of time it
              had to go through a tough time, not only linked to the loss of the
              loved one, but also related to the financial question that arose
              and was pressing, how to pay for the morgue, without delay, and
              how to repatriate the body. And very often the family alone were
              not able to take care of it immediately, the members of the family
              usually had to enter into unusual practices such as asking for
              alms in front of the church, getting into debt without having an
              idea about where the money will come from to repay. <br />
              In the meantime, during the vigils, there were many brave
              Cameroonians who even helped, but the funds were very often
              misdirected and did not achieve the main goal which was to take
              care of the funerals of the deceased in general.

              2009
            </h4>
            <p className='text-lg leading-8 px-6 sm:px-14 text-base-content'>
              We remember that in 2009, one of us was part of an association
              where, after the death of one of their members, they undertook to
              carry out a collection of funds in their association, each member
              had to pay $300 at the time, and it was quite insufficient to take
              care of the funeral of the deceased.
              <br /> Having observed these gloomy moments, and based on our
              personal experiences, we began to think about other ways forward,
              and the idea of SAGI came about at the end of 2009 when we met six
              of us over more than two months to set up SAGI, the initial idea
              was that anytime a member passes away, the only thing the family
              should do was to mourn their loved one, and that the SAGI
              community was suppose to do the rest. The initial bureau was
              composed of two founding members and 3 other countrymen who
              accepted to give their time to make the organization succeed: Mr.
              Gaston T., Dieudonne W. were amongst those who accepted to
              sacrifice their time to help SAGI to take off.

            <p className='text-lg leading-8 px-6 sm:px-14 text-base-content'>
              After registering sagi with the Maryland Busness Authority, we had
              to face the tough part of putting our idea into practice, by first
              making people register to SAGI, we went door to door, from
              associations to associations during their meetings, to convincing
              them to join, we faced a lot of difficulties, we encountered not
              only skeptics but above all, some compatriots who called us all
              sort of names, from dreamers to a band of bandits having just a
              plan to defraud Cameroonians, but knowing the scope of what we
              were presenting to the Cameroonians, we continued, especially
              thanks to the support of some in the community such as Mr. Norbert
              Yousse or Mrs. Anne Tchuisseu to name just a few. <br />
              And the worst happened when we recorded our first death in SAGI,
              an association in Kentucky, the first contribution was for more
              than $15 per person for that single death, in the end the funds
              were not enough and we had to spend our own money to just to take
              care of the morgue.

              After the difficult phase described above, SAGI began to make
              itself known on the ground, the associations which had subscribed
              began to see the merits of such a structure, and we began to raise
              funds for the dead each time it was necessary, and moreover the
              Cameroonians had confidence in the structure, the Cameroonian
              consular authorities had taken note and also appreciated. it
              became easier to convince the skeptics and raise fund because the
              structure had taken off.

              In 2016, the fellow countryman initially chosen to lead the first
              years of SAGI got a little carried away by SAGI's initial success
              and at that point began to make unilateral changes, he managed to
              push out of SAGI bureau members like Mr. Gaston T. Mr. Diedonne W.
              or Mr. Emmanuel M., brought on board his friends and members of
              his family. In October 2016, we notified him of the deviation that
              SAGI was taking and invited him to a meeting so that together we
              can try to put things back in order, but he hit us with a lawsuit
              accompanied with a restraining order, threatening to jail us over
              it, claiming that we had tried to destabilize his organization.

              noble idea that SAGI takes care of death as soon as it occurs so
              that the family does not have to wait months to see the funerals
              of their loved one taken care of by the SAGI community as
